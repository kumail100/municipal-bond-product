    <div class="container">
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Municoin is a revolutionary platform that leverages blockchain technology to tokenize municipal bonds. By bridging the gap between traditional bond markets and decentralized finance (DeFi), we provide global access to infrastructure investments. Our vision is to democratize municipal investments, allowing everyday investors to take part in projects that have historically been limited to large institutions.</p><br/>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to make municipal investments accessible, transparent, and efficient, by using tokenization and blockchain technology to reduce barriers, increase liquidity, and provide fair returns for all investors.</p>

  <!-- About the Project Section -->
  <section id="about-project" class="about-project">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Municoin's goal is to transform how municipalities raise capital for infrastructure and public projects. Traditionally, municipalities issue bonds to raise funds, but these bonds often have limited accessibility, complex structures, and lack liquidity. Municoin simplifies and modernizes this process by tokenizing the bonds and introducing new mechanisms like fractional ownership and automated payments through smart contracts.</p>
      
      <h3>The Plan</h3>
      <p>Our approach is to work directly with municipalities to create tokenized bonds that represent future revenue streams from taxes or public utility payments. These tokenized bonds will be sold to investors globally, allowing them to participate in infrastructure and public service projects with greater flexibility and ease.</p>

      <h3>Why You Should Be Excited</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Access:</strong> Investors worldwide can now participate in municipal bond markets.</li>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain ensures complete transparency of transactions and payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Tokenized bonds can be traded on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for greater liquidity.</li>
        <li><strong>Fractional Ownership:</strong> Small investors can now invest in bonds with a smaller capital commitment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>Municipalities issue bonds in the form of digital tokens on a blockchain. The bond terms—such as interest rate, maturity date, and repayment schedule—are encoded into smart contracts. Investors purchase these tokenized bonds, which are backed by future municipal revenues. Payments (including principal and interest) are automatically handled by the smart contract, reducing administrative costs and errors.</p>
