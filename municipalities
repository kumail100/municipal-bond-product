Key Features of the Smart Contract:
Issue Bond: Municipalities can issue bonds by specifying the principal, interest rate, and maturity date.
Buy Bond: Investors can buy bonds by sending the principal amount to the contract.
Interest Payment: The contract allows for automatic interest payments to bondholders (based on the bond’s interest rate).
Mature Bond: When the bond matures, the municipality can mark it as “inactive,” preventing further interactions.
How the Municipal Bond Product Works:
Issuer (Municipality):
A town or city issues the bond by interacting with the smart contract. This involves specifying the bond’s terms, such as interest rate and maturity date.
The smart contract stores these details and makes them available to potential investors.
Investor:
Interested investors can purchase bonds by sending funds to the smart contract. The contract ensures that investors are buying bonds for the correct price (the principal amount).
Interest Payments:
The bond issuer (municipality) can make periodic interest payments to bondholders using the smart contract.
The contract will automatically distribute payments to bondholders based on their holdings.
Maturity:
When the bond reaches its maturity date, the municipality can call a function to mark the bond as matured. At this point, the principal repayment can be made to bondholders.
Conclusion:
By creating a Web3 Municipal Bond Product, small and mid-sized towns can leverage blockchain to issue bonds in a decentralized and efficient manner. Tokenizing bonds allows for fractional ownership, broadens access to investors, and automates processes like interest payments and governance. This could provide municipalities with an entirely new way of raising capital while providing investors with a transparent, secure, and liquid investment vehicle.
